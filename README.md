## Externships/Insight Series

These are 1-5 day programs designed to help you get to know (and get noticed by) a company. Some are in-person, some includes stipend. Activities include webinars, training, networking event, and hackathon. Note that almost every big-tech & bank has one of these program, but I'm only highlighting ones exclusive to underclassmen
